# TQFT's and Frobenius Algebras

This repository contains the source code used to
create my video on TQFT's and Frobenius algebras.
The visuals of this video were created using [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org).
You can find an outline of the project in [this file](src/outline.md).

NOTE: The blender files make use of hdri's for the environment lighting.
These are not packaged with the blend file itself to save space.
They come pre-installed with blender, but can also be found on
hdri-haven.

NOTE: since I experienced some problems with video and audio syncing
in playback with motion-canvas, I made some final adjustments in blender's VSE.
Because of this, the motion-canvas preview might not line up exactly with the
audio.
